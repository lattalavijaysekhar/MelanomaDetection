# Melanoma Cancer Detection Using CNN
Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that develops from melanocytes, the cells responsible for producing melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color. It is one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer because it can grow rapidly and spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body if not detected and treated early.

Melanoma cancer detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is an application of deep learning techniques for diagnosing skin cancer from images. CNNs are particularly effective for image classification tasks because they automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from raw pixel inputs, which is crucial for medical imaging tasks like melanoma detection.
