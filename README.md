# Melanoma Cancer Detection Using CNN
Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that develops from melanocytes, the cells responsible for producing melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color. It is one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer because it can grow rapidly and spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body if not detected and treated early.

Melanoma cancer detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is an application of deep learning techniques for diagnosing skin cancer from images. CNNs are particularly effective for image classification tasks because they automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from raw pixel inputs, which is crucial for medical imaging tasks like melanoma detection.

## General Information

### Problem Statement
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
